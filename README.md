👋 
- Hi, I’m @Pslempers
👀
- I’m interested in becoming a game designer using my composing skills and passion for games.
🌱
- 2020-2023: I’m currently learning Unreal Engine 5, C++, pixel art, 3D game design, and the German language!
- 2024: I'm now experimenting with ChatGPT and making small Javascript web-apps to learn.
💞️
- I’m looking to collaborate on a game jam, to meet new creators.
