- 👋 
- Hi, I’m @pslempers
- 👀
- I’m interested in becoming a web developer and interactive designer, utilizing my composing skills and passion for games.
- 🌱
- 2020-2023: I learned some Unreal Engine 5, C++, pixel art, 3D game design, and the German language!
- 2024: I'm now experimenting with ChatGPT and making small JavaScript web-apps to learn.
- 2025: I'm enrolled at Humber Polytechnic for Web Development to get coding for real!
- 💞️
- I’m looking to collaborate on a game jam to meet new creators.
